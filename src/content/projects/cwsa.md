# Summary

Doctors and nurses working on the front line in busy NHS organisations need access to lots of data which is held on multiple dedicated systems. The Patient Portal provides a modern web app experience bringing all of this information together in a single, easy to use application.

The application allows staff to search for a patient and view demographics, notes, xrays and results from multiple source systems.

## Bespoke View Components

### Technology

A bespoke timeline was built as a .net Core View Component to show a date order view of pathology results.

The View component takes in the patient identifier and consumes an api to display all blood results in date order.

### Big List

Big list was inspired to help staff easily switch and filter long lists of caseloads and wards. Big List was utilised in a number of places within the app.

### Patient Banner

Patient Banner brings all the information to your finger tips. A Simple, elegant banner across the screen with the essential information about a patient. Click the banner to see more detailed information.
